This app based on video lessons course (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcvhF2Wqh7DNVy1OCUpG3i5lyxyBWhGZ8) and server of https://it-kamasutra.com/. For which many thanks to the creator DMITRIY KUZYUBERDIN.


# This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The application is currently using a technology stack:

- Redux in conjunction with react-redux - as state container (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux);

- Reselect - “selector” library for Redux (https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect);

- React Router - declarative routing for React (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router);

- Redux Thunk - thunk middleware for Redux (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk);

- Axios - promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js (https://github.com/axios/axios);

- React Hook Form - forms with easy-to-use validation (https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form);

 - Yup - schema builder for value parsing and validation (https://github.com/jquense/yup);
